# Quick Start Guide

## What Changed?

Your website now saves data to **Google Sheets** instead of a local database. This means:
- ✅ You can view data from anywhere (phone, laptop, anywhere!)
- ✅ No need to run a server
- ✅ Works perfectly with Netlify
- ✅ Easy to view and manage

## Setup Checklist

Follow the detailed guide in `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md`, but here's the quick version:

1. ✅ **Create Google Sheet** with headers (see guide)
2. ✅ **Set up Apps Script** (copy code from guide)
3. ✅ **Deploy as Web App** (get the URL)
4. ✅ **Paste URL in 2 files**:
   - `discovery.html` (line ~136)
   - `Risk assessment/public/script.js` (line ~5)
5. ✅ **Test locally**
6. ✅ **Deploy to Netlify**

## Where to Find Your Data

Once set up, just open your Google Sheet - all submissions will appear there automatically!
